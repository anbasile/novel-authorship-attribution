# Novel Approaches to Authorship Attribution

This repository contains my master's thesis and some code related to authorship attribution.

* [Final Thesis](../../raw/master/thesis/ThesisMain.pdf)

The code is never got cleaned up, but you can find a cleaner version of some experiments as well as
 some more write ups and tutorials about Authorship Attribution and text classification in [my repo for the 
 Yelp 2017 dataset challenge](https://github.com/sixhobbits/yelp-dataset-2017).
 
 Feel free to contact me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/sixhobbits) or by email (gareth@dwyer.co.za) if you have any questions 
 or want to discuss anything related to Authorship Attribution, Author profiling, text classification, etc.
