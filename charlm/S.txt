In order to proceed with the rentals procedures, our family lawyer will have to draw up an Agreement, which will be signed by the landlord and the tenant and the main reason for this document to be prepared is for the both parties to be legally secured.

The document will be sent to you via e-mail so as for you to read through and understand its contents.

More so, if you eventually agree with the terms of the contract, you will have to proceed with the payment to our bank account and get back to me with the receipt of payment from your bank for reference purpose and I hope you understand what i am saying here? The reason why you will have to send me the receipt of the payment from your bank is for me to be able to send it to my late father's lawyer who has been working with him for the past 14 years and who has also been working for me since my father died 18 months ago.

Here are the required details for the preparation of the tenancy Agreement Form:
1. Your full name
2. Your moving-in and moving-out date.
3. Your current address

Also, i will in return send you a scanned copy of my ID also so that you can be able to see for your self that you are dealing with a legit and serious minded person.

I will await to be able to have the required details so that our family lawyer can be able to prepare the contract.

You can practise.

Regards,

Sandy.

Thanks for your e-mail and interest in renting my room, i want you to know that i have forwarded your details to our family lawyer who is already in the process of preparing the contract which i am going to send to you along with the scanned copy of my ID.

You are to proceed with the payment of deposit after agreeing with the terms of the contract. The first month rent would be paid on your moving in date.
